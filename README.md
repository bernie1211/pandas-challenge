This is my analysis of this data collection. 
1. Schools with the highest budget on each student tend to not have the better performing students compared to schools that spend a lesser amount.
2. With the analysis of (Statement (1)) we can assume that larger schools have lower performances with students based on the fact that larger schools have a wider budget compared to small schools.
3. Private Schools seem to have better grades than District Schools.
